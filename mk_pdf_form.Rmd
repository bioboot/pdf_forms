## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Q & A text box 

**Q1** Here is a first question?

\TextField[name=Q1]{}

**Q2** Another question here?

\TextField[name=Q2]{}

> **Q3.** What about some checkbox action?

\CheckBox[name=Q3.1]{Option 1}
\CheckBox[name=Q3.2]{Option 2}
\CheckBox[name=Q3.3]{Option 3}


>**Q5** Answer by picking from a dropdown menu of options?

\ChoiceMenu[combo, name=Q4, width=2cm, default=Belfast]{}{Los Angels, Belfast, Newry, Berlin, San Diego, London}  


## Including plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
